`signs` makes it easy to use typographically accurate minus signs
in plots, markdown, dashboards, or other displays.

Ask any typography nut, and they can walk you through the differences
among 4 glyphs that look almost alike:

* the hyphen-minus (-, ASCII 45)
* the en-dash (`r "\u2013"`, Unicode 2013)
* the em-dash (`r "\u2014"`, Unicode 2014)
* the true minus (`r "\u2212"`, Unicode 2212)

The en-dash and em-dash are named after their widths
(the width of an `n` and `m`, respectively).
The true minus is the width of a digit and sits a bit higher than the others.
The hyphen-minus, an ASCII convention, is the only one we get on our keyboards.

These may be easier to distinguish in some fonts than others.
In most fixed-width coding fonts, for example,
they're nearly (if not totally) indistinguishable.
But a good font for plotting will usually have a different glyph for each.

For me, using a true minus is like brewing high-end tea
or wearing my favorite socks.
Maybe nobody else notices, but it still feels good to me.
If you feel the same way, this package may grow on you!

## Installation

`signs` is not yet available on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org).
You can install it from [GitHub](https://github.com/BenjaminWolfe/signs) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("BenjaminWolfe/signs")
```

## Examples

Using `signs` is simple, especially if you're familiar
with functions like `number()`, `number_format()`,
`comma()`, `comma_format()`, `percent()`, and `percent_format()`
from the [`scales`](https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/number_format.html)
package.
The package adds 2 functions analogous to these: `signs()` and `signs_format()`.

### Fixed-Width Fonts (indistinguishable)

As mentioned above, the difference is hard to see with a fixed-width typeface.
That's not a problem with the package; it's just how these fonts work.

```{r}
library(scales)
library(signs)

x <- seq(-5, 5)
number(x)
signs(x)
```

### Plots

We can see the difference in a plot.
First, with `scales::number()`:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

p <- 
  ggplot(sleep) +
  aes(group, extra) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Drug") +
  ylab("Extra Sleep (hrs)") +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank())

p +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-4, 6),
    breaks = seq(-4, 6),
    labels = number
  )
```

Now with `signs::signs()`:

```{r}
p +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-4, 6),
    breaks = seq(-4, 6),
    labels = signs
  )
```

We can use `signs()` in `geom_text()` as well.
And we can pass it any of the arguments we would use with `scales::number()`,
such as `accuracy` or `scale`.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

label_hours <- function(mapping) {
  geom_text_repel(
    mapping,
    nudge_x = -.1,
    direction = "y",
    segment.size = .2,
    segment.color = "grey75",
    hjust = "right"
  )
}

p +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-4, 6),
    breaks = seq(-4, 6),
    labels = signs
  ) +
  label_hours(
    aes(label = signs(extra, accuracy = .1))
  )
```

In datasets where the point is to show change from zero,
we can also add plus signs for positive numbers.
Notice here we use `signs_format()` as well,
analogous to `number_format()`
and the other function factories in the `scales` package.
`signs_format()` returns a function that will format a numeric vector
with minus signs.

```{r}
p +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-4, 6),
    breaks = seq(-4, 6),
    labels = signs_format(add_plusses = TRUE)
  ) +
  label_hours(
    aes(label = signs(extra, add_plusses = TRUE, accuracy = .1))
  )
```

Sometimes we want a more minimal look.
For plots on the interval `(-1, 1)`, we can trim leading zeros.
And if we want we can leave zero itself blank:

```{r}
p +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-.8, .8),
    breaks = seq(-.8, .8, by = .2),
    labels = signs_format(
      add_plusses = TRUE,
      trim_leading_zeros = TRUE,
      treatment_at_zero = "blank",
      accuracy = .01
    )
  ) +
  label_hours(
    aes(
      label = signs(
        extra,
        add_plusses = TRUE,
        trim_leading_zeros = TRUE,
        accuracy = .1
        )
      )
    )
```

You can use any arbitrary function to format your number,
rather than `scales::number()`.
Here we make the ridiculous assumption that everybody gets 8 hours of sleep,
just so we can use `scales::percent()`.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

q <- 
  sleep %>% 
  mutate(percent_change = extra / 8) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  aes(group, percent_change) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Drug") +
  ylab("Extra Sleep (% above 8 hrs)")

q +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-.25, .75),
    breaks = seq(-.25, .75, by = .25),
    labels = signs_format(format = percent, add_plusses = TRUE, accuracy = 1)
  ) +
  label_hours(
    aes(
      label = signs(
        percent_change,
        format = percent,
        add_plusses = TRUE,
        accuracy = .1
      )
    )
  )
```

You can also use a plus-or-minus symbol in front of the zero.

```{r message=FALSE}
q +
  scale_y_continuous(
    limits = c(-.25, .75),
    breaks = seq(-.25, .75, by = .25),
    labels = signs_format(
      format = percent,
      add_plusses = TRUE,
      treatment_at_zero = "symbol",
      accuracy = 1
    )
  ) +
  label_hours(
    aes(
      label = signs(
        percent_change,
        format = percent,
        add_plusses = TRUE,
        treatment_at_zero = "symbol",
        accuracy = .1
      )
    )
  )
```
